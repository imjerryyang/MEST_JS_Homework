/*  1. Explain the following code:
 *
 *  function func() {
 *      console.log(this);
 *  }
 *
 *	function func(){ console.log(this);}
 *	undefined
 *	func()
 *	Window → about:newtab
 *
 *  func(); // what is the output? Why?
 
 	The output gives the Window object. This is because the 'this' keyword was not called from an object and therefore 
	called the closest object it could reach which is the Window object.
 *
 *  var obj = {
 *      func: func // what is the second func here? The second func is the value assigned to the func attribute
 *  };
 *	
 *  obj.func(); //what is the output? try to explain why.
 *	var obj = { func:func};
 *	undefined
 *	obj.func
 *	function func()
 *	The obj.func returns a function. This i cannot explain!
 *
 *  obj.func.bind(window)(); // what is the output? why?
 *	obj.func.bind(window)()
 *	Window → about:newtab This is because the window argument in the bind function tells the bind function to bind the func to 
 	the window object.
 *
 *  obj.func.bind(this)();  // what is the output? why? This returns the Window object because the 'this' keyword calls the 
 *	window object.
 *
 *  var people = {
 *      name: 'ashwin',
 *      age: 40
 *  };
 *
 *  obj.func.bind(people)(); //what is the output? why?
 */

*  obj.func.bind(people)()
*  Object { name: "Ashwin", age: 40 } 
*  Because bind is a function that is calling people object.



/* 2. write a function to convert first letter of every word in a string
 *     to upper case.
 *     eg input = 'hi, welcome to mest;'
 *        output = 'Hi Welcome To Mest';
 *        input2 = 'today is Sunday';
 *        output2 = 'Today is Sunday';
 */

var str = 'hi welcome to mest';
function capitalizeFirstLetter(str) {
	return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}

var str2 = 'today is Sunday'
function capitalizeFirstLetter(str) {
	return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}

/*
 *  3. Write reg expresion for email validation(This is not an easy 
 *  question, please make sure you do your research on this).
 *
 */

email validation can be done using regular expressions. 
function validateEmail(email) {
	var x = /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9[{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
	return x.test(email);
}


/*
 * 4. what is localStorage and sessionStorge under window object? What is the
 *    difference
 */
local storage is a web application that can store data locally within the user's browser. the storage is per origin(per domain and protocol).one can easily access the same data.

session storage store data for one session. Therefore, data can be lost when the browser tab is closed.
differences:
local storage                                          
1. is more secure
2. can store large amount of data
3. cannot affect the performance of the website
4. has no coockies
5. storage limit is large at least 5mb
6. information is never transfered to the server
7. all the pages from the origin one can be stored

session storage:
1. data can be lost once web browser is closed
2. has expiry date
3. it is almost equal to the local storage object
